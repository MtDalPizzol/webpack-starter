# Webpack Starter

This is a simple Webpack boilerplate to write web projects using ES6 and SCSS.
It's an example showing how you can use Webpack in any web project, since some people think it's meant to be used only with things like React, Angular and Express.

For now, it dosn't minify anything for real production environments, but it's a good starting point for that college homework...

## Features

* **[ES6](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/)** support with **[Babel](https://babeljs.io/)**.
* **[SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SCSS_FOR_SASS_USERS.html)** compile.
* Development server with browser auto refresh.
* Simple nom minified builds (for now)
* No Gulp, no Grunt. Just **[npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts)**

## Quick start

```bash
# clone this repo
$ git clone https://github.com/MtDalPizzol/webpack-starter.git my-app

# change directory to your app
$ cd my-app

# install the dependencies with npm
$ npm install

# start the development server
$ npm start
```

After that, simply open the `app/index.html` file in your browser.

The styles and scripts are loaded from http://localhost:8080 (the [webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html))

### Building files

```bash
npm run build
```
